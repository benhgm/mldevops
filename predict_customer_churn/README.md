## Project Description
This code predicts credit card customer churn using a Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regressor.

## Files and data description
### churn_library.py
Holds all the functions required to perform the model training and prediction

### churn_scrip_logging_and_tests.py
Holds test functions to test the functions defined in churn_library.py

### predictor.py
Prediction module used to run the prediction and training

## Running Files
To train a model and perform a prediction, run
```
python predictor.py
```

Thereafter, check that the prediction module ran smoothly and all files required for analysis and models are saved using
```
python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
```
